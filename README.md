# XNA MD2 Model Loader
An MD2 (Quake II Style) model loader and animator for Microsoft XNA Games Development Framework 1.0.

This is a legacy project. I originally submitted this to [SourceForge in 2007](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xnamd2/files/xnamd2/), but am moving it to GitHub as I look to consolidate and preserve my projects.

[Memorix101](https://github.com/Memorix101) ported this project to XNA 4.0 / MonoGame in 2015. Their [upgraded version can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/Memorix101/MonoGame-MD2-Loader).
